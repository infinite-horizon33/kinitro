# Overview

Kinitro incentivizes the emergence of agents that can conquer various tasks across different environments.
Miners publish agents to compete, validators peform rollouts and evaluate the agents, and reward miners
based on the results. All this happens in real-time and can easily be viewed by anyone through our [dashboard](https://kinitro.ai/dashboard).

## Repository Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/threetau/kinitro
   cd kinitro
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment and install dependencies**

   ```bash
   uv venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   uv sync --dev
   uv pip install -e .
   ```

After setting up the repository locally, the next steps will depend on what role you play in the Kinitro ecosystem.

## Platform Roles

- **Miners** upload agent artifacts to our backend and submit a signed commitment to the Bittensor chain. Use the [miner guide](./miner.md) to configure packaging, uploading, and on-chain commits.
- **Validators** maintain a websocket connection to the backend, persist jobs in pgqueuer, and relay results and episode logs. Follow the [validator guide](./validator/validator.md) for environment setup and operations.
- **Evaluator operators** run the Ray orchestrator that spins up submission containers, executes benchmarks, and logs telemetry. See the [evaluator architecture notes](./architecture/evaluator.md) for details.
- **Backend operators** deploy the FastAPI service that monitors the chain, schedules jobs, emits realtime updates, and approve pending leader candidates before new rewards go live.

## Learn the Architecture

Start with the [architecture introduction](./architecture/introduction.md) for a system-level diagram and data flow. Then dive into specific components:

- [Orchestrator internals](./architecture/orchestrator.md)
- [Evaluator workers](./architecture/evaluator.md)
- [Incentive mechanism](./architecture/incentive.md)
